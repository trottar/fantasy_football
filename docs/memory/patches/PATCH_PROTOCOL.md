# Patch Protocol

Every meaningful patch/release must:

1. Identify exact source/pre-state.
2. State one narrow hypothesis/objective.
3. Preserve validated subsystem boundaries.
4. Make one coherent change.
5. Run targeted diagnostics/tests.
6. Inspect actual evidence/output.
7. Run full tests and `compileall` where applicable.
8. Validate generated artifacts, not just generator code.
9. Re-test exact delivered package for releases when environment permits.
10. Include rollback/recovery for risky local procedures.
11. Update durable memory in the same Git checkpoint.
12. Never include secrets/private raw data/caches.

Release notes should explicitly state:

`durable_memory_updated: true`
